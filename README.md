# Peer-to-Peer--P2P--Chatting-Application

  I developed a P2P chatting application in Python. Firstly, I created my own P2P protocol architecture using low-level TCP-UDP protocols (socket programming). It is using the centralized index approach. I implemented the three key operations (join, search, and chat) for my protocol. This P2P application also allows group chatting. I used the "lobby" logic to design such a chatting system.
  
  Firstly, a user communicates with the central server to perform the registration process. Then, the user enters in to the system and sends a request to other users who want to start a chat. If other users accept this request, they start chatting. With this system architecture I have designed, many users can communicate independently of each other. Because of this project, I developed myself in "multi-threading" management.
